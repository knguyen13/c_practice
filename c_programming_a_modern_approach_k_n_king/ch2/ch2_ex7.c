/* Q: Chapter 2, Exercise 7
 *
 * Which of the following are keywords in C?
 * (a) for
 * (b) If
 * (c) main
 * (d) printf
 * (e) while
 */

int main(void)
{
    /* test for legal identifiers vs keywords */
    int for, If, main, printf, while;
}

/* A:
 *
 * for and while are keywords. If is not a keyword because C is a case-sensitive language; 
 * if, on the other hand, is a keyword.
